# Why Python?
<hr>

Some thoughts on [Matlab vs. Python](https://realpython.com/matlab-vs-python/)

+++

## Interpreted vs Compiled
<hr>

Python is an interpreted language, which makes it easy to use. A short and imprecise definition of differences is (adapted from a [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3265357/compiled-vs-interpreted-languages)):

* **Compiled language:** Entire program is translated to machine code at once, then the machine code is run by the CPU. Advantages are:

  * Faster performance by directly using the native code of the target machine
  * Opportunity to apply quite powerful optimisations during the compile stage

* **Interpreted language:** Program is read line-by-line and as soon as a line is read the machine instructions for that line are executed by the CPU. Advantages are:

  * Easier to implement (writing good compilers is very hard!!)
  * No need to run a compilation stage: can execute code directly "on the fly"
  * Can be more convenient for dynamic languages

At this point, few languages these days are purely compiled or purely interpreted, and is often a mix (see [blog post](https://orangejuiceliberationfront.com/the-difference-between-compiler-and-interpreter/)).

## Ease of Use
<hr>

Python can be downloaded from a number of different sources, called **distributions** (Example: Python downloaded from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/)).

### Google Colab - No Configuration Needed

[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), or "Colaboratory", allows users to write and execute Python in a browser, without a need for configuration.

### Anaconda

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) is a Python distribution commonly used for math, science, engineering, and data science applications.

### Other Python Distributions

* [official Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/python/)
