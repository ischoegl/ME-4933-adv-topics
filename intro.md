# ME 4933 Advanced Topics in Mechanical Engineering
<hr>

## Applied Computational Methods
<hr>

The objective is to introduce a new class introducing ME students to
**Scientific Computing** (including introductions to **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**). Ultimately, this should become a course with a designated course number. Initially, it will run as **ME 4933**; while a main audience will be graduate students, it should also be offered to upper-level undergraduate students (especially those transitioning into the MSME program).

```{admonition} Work in progress
Proposed topics in form of a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org). *Everything* is up for discussion.
```
